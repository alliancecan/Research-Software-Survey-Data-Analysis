"1",21,"This is not clear enough. It should be more focused on what the software does. What stakeholders does it serve? What functions does it perform? What is its utility? Not sure if 'broad perspective as an emerging and complex intersection of tools, disciplines, services, platforms, hardware, resources, and people"" does that.","Other"
"2",30,"I don't see how research software can be defined as hardware.
Likewise, I don't think that software can be defined as people.

Software is a tool that provides functions needed by the research group.","Other"

"4",35,"The phrases ""data science"", ""machine learning', and 'artificial intelligence"" are not in your definition, but I write code in these areas every day and they are fundamental to  my research. So really, your definition is weak.","Other"
"5",40,"Software is not disciplines, hardware, or people.","Other"
"6",45,"This definition is so broad i wonder how useful it is. Is there anything that doesn't meet this definition of research software?","Other"
"7",46,"This seems too broad to me.  I would take research software as ""software developed during the course of research and/or used in research activities"".  While services, people, etc ARE critical for the creation, use, maintenance of research software, I would consider them to be part of the broader ""research software ecosystem"".  I would distinguish the difference.","Other"
"8",49,"Too many words yet not specific enough.

""Research software directly serves science for the public good.""","Other"
"9",52,"The definition seems too broad to me, especially the inclusion of people.","Other"
"10",58,"Kind of skips over the fact that software is fundamentally code.  A bit odd that you fold in 'hardware'.  Not sure what you mean by 'tools' in this context -- software can be a tool of sorts.  What do you mean here?","Other"
"11",59,"wow that's general and vague. No relationship to either software or research? it's basically saying that research software is anything that involves the intersection of any two or more of tools, disciplines, services, platforms, hardware, resources and people? I can think of a lot of things that meet that definition that are related to neither research nor software.

I'd define it as something more like digital tools used to conduct, enable, or facilitate some aspect of research, plus (maybe) the supports and services required to enable them to be used. 

I understand that you didn't want to exclude anything, but a definition that includes more things that don't belong to the specified domain than ones that do is not at all useful. 

Definitions need to exclude as well as include.  Or maybe you do mean to say that a hammer being used by a person as part of a home-repair service is research software?

"12",72,"I don't agree with the term emerging, as some software e.g. BLAS and LAPACK is decades old and would still qualify as research software.

On the other hand rsync for example started out as research software but would not be qualified as tooling, in that case &quot;emerging&quot; is more applicable.","Other"
"13",95,"La phrase est inutilement alambiquee. On doit la lire 3 fois pour comprendre qu'elle ne veut rien dire.","Other"
"14",99,"I agree with almost all the wording but do suggest removing the word ""hardware"" from the above definition, since this is about ""Research SOFTWARE"".","Other"

"16",112,"Il me semble qu'un logiciel c'est un assemblage de libraries et de code afin de resaliser une ou plusieurs taches. La definition presentee me semble plus proche de ressource informationnelle ou outils de recherche.","Other"
"17",126,"My comprehension of ""research software"": research (adjective) software (noun), therefore its definition should include the things that lives digitally and must exclude the aforementioned hardware, and people.

My comprehension of ""software research"": software (adjective) research (noun), in this case, it is the research itself and it should include the people, the activities, etc.

It makes sense to me to show a file, a process, or even a concept and tell that this is a research software, or this is part of a research software.
But it does not make sense to point at a disk, a cable or a person and tell that this is part of a research software. Software and hardware are concepts that were defined in opposition and to include one into the other would only cause confusion to an external observer.","Other"
"18",127,"Might be worth including to the definition that the aim of this complex intersection is to support research.","Other"

"22",145,"That's not a definition!  It's not ""from a broad perspective"".  Research software is software generated during research, or used during research.","Other"
"23",148,"My understanding of research software is software or tools used by researchers for conducting their academic research.","Other"
"24",149,"This definition is so broad it doesn't convey any meaning. For fun, I removed the word ""research software"" and asked ChatGPT 10 possible words or expressions to fill the gap, its answer were:

Technology

Digital ecosystem
Information technology landscape
Tech industry
Cyberworld
Emerging technologies
Digital infrastructure
Tech landscape

"30",207,"The purpose of this broad range of items is missing.
In other words, I would add something at the end of the sentence like at least: to support research. If not 'to support research capacities and projects'","Other"

"39",272,"Research software is written to support and carry out research, for examples simulation codes, data analysis and machine learning applications and libraries, automation scripts, and web portals for collaborative research and data sharing.  Research software experts combine software expertise with research knowledge to create or maintain research software defined in this way.   The definition of research software should thus not include other digital research technologies that it interacts with, e.g. it should not include hardware nor non-research specific software such as contact  management systems, communications systems, or account management.","Other"
"40",274,"How can hardware be a subset of software? One can build software into hardware, but hardly the other way around. Software is a mathematical construct to process data and fit models, primarily, one would hope.","Other"
"41",288,"I would define research software as digital programs installed on your computer/licensed used to conduct research (e.g. NVivo). If I was pushed to extend it more broadly, I might include research tools/platforms (e.g. the DMP Assistant) which are browser-based.

"71",497,"If the term is ""research software"" then by definition that must exclude disciplines, hardware, and people. It might also exclude ""resources"" depending on how that word is used.

"72",503,"I would not include hardware in the definition of a term including the word software - to me they are not the same. I consider research software to be the actual software programs used to conduct research or data analysis such as SPSS, NVivo, Excel, etc. I think the term defined breading is referring to Research Assets or Research Ecosystems inclusive of software, hardware, tools, and people.","Other"
"73",507,"I don't think in terms of research software. I think in terms of libraries for R and Python.","Other"

"79",539,"In the end, this definition seems off. Software is software. If it doesn't have code, it isn't software.
