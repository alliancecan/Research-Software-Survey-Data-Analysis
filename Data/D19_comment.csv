"1",21,"D19","Yes...we designed our solution with these principles in mind. To that end, research and supporting research data is easily 'findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable' using our platform...but also under the control of the Principal Investigator (PI). The PI is able to manage access to research data or subsets of it as well as seamlessly manage any required agreements (such as data-sharing/publication agreements) using eSignature capabilities."
"2",29,"D19","Also this group: https://fair-software.nl/"
"3",112,"D19","la plupart des chercheurs ne cconnaissent pas bien les principes FAIR. Il y a beaucoup de sensibilisation a faire"
"4",113,"D19","Ça va prendre des formations de ça."
"5",203,"D19","While I personally have some basic familiarity with the principles, the project PIs may not be and there have been no discussions of these principles within our development team."
"6",204,"D19","a little"
"7",205,"D19","I was not aware of FAIR4RS but there basic assertion is common sense."
"8",235,"D19","The iReceptor Gateway was built on and adheres to FAIR principles"
"9",310,"D19","TOTALLY!"
"10",324,"D19","I don't know FIAR4US and therefore cannot answer the following question."
"11",330,"D19","When a large CFD model produces 10's of TB of output, it is difficult to properly share as most repositories can't deal with that size of output. But we can't just point to the data on Alliance systems..."
"12",338,"D19","I am aware of FAIR, but not FAIR4RS"
"13",341,"D19","We apply FAIR principles to our data, primarily, but we also attempt to release open-source software whenever possible."
"14",363,"D19","Yes, we have incorporated the FAIR Principles into our strategic plans for NatureCounts and Motus. "
"15",406,"D19","We intend to work towards following guidance along these lines for software used to produce or manipulate data."
"16",424,"D19","we use Creative Commons"
"17",469,"D19","Very limited"
"18",495,"D19","The software also tries to follow CARE and OCAP principles"
"19",501,"D19","Hope to share that way after we complete development, test the platform, and then know what we can contribute. "
"20",503,"D19","I am not involves in software development. "
"21",508,"D19","Aware of FAIR principles but not specific to research software"
"22",523,"D19","Nous connaissons les principes FAIR mais pas specifiquement FAIR4RS, leur application aux logiciels de recherche."
