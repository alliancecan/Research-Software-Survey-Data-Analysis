Question,Internal.ID,answer
C2,474,"As a research software developer and one that believes this should be delivered as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) service to all researchers, I'm answering yes."
C2,146,My research depends almost entirely on software use and development.
C2,512,"Yes, but ""research software"" based on my extended definition above."
C2,404,Genomics analysis is all software.
C2,1350,We develop software on an ongoing basis; use existing research software.
C2,1104,"Yes, but I wish we had more dedicated research software, not making do with MS Windows applications."
C2,127,"Given that definition it's hard to say, but I need to use survey software, analysis software, several programming tools and environments, and so on.

Do I develop research software? I have written code that is used by others, But who knows."
C2,240,"it's critical to the research of the people I support, not my own."
C2,295,ABSOLUETLY. IT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART CURRENTLY
C2,51,"En etant que je suis informaticien au support a la recherche pour toute l'universite. La reponse serait : pour la majorite de la communaute de recherche oui, les logiciels de recherche sont essentiels mais pas pour tous."
C2,1177,"Je ne fais pas de recherche, je suis analyste en soutien."
C2,1312,"My role do not include research, research Software is however critical to my work."
C2,239,not applicable
C2,329,"My research is entirely computational/ theoretical, and hence based on research software that either exists (usually) or is developed by us (sometimes)"
C2,1285,"By either definitions -- software (code) and all the necessary supports for that code (hardware, people, etc....) are critical to my research"
C2,79,depends on what is meant with research software
C2,631,Absolutely. Custom written software is integral to all parts of our research projects.
C2,189,Research software as defined above is foundational to my work without which I would not be able to do what I do.
C2,1049,research software as defined upper is crucial for real large collaboration between researchers; sharing information and discoveries; it's a leverage
C2,586,Pour mon poste il s'agit surtout de soutenir l'utilisation des logiciels de recherche.
C2,508,"Yes, without it research are reliant on standard software and manual workflows that block innovation."
C2,228,"If one has data, usually one requires software to treat them."
C2,678,"Our research is focussed on a continually developing numerical model for our applications, with associated scripts, and then the needed analysis and visualization tools."
C2,424,Our entire research program would not run if not for research software
C2,391,My job is to develop research software.
C2,34,"I am not doing research, but rather facilitating research. But it is essential to do that. "
C2,1361,"Everything is digital, therefore everything requires software. Bu the above definition, it is almost impossible to conceive of a scenario where I would answer No."
C2,1298,"Examples of software critical to my research are perfsonar, openstack, and xrootd."
C2,126,"With the more comprehensive definition, research software is fundamentally important to my research. "
C2,1353,Essential
C2,1481,"My team generally doesn't have access to them. Thus, we don't know how different it would be to have one available. I am sure it would help, though. "
