C1,21,"This is not clear enough. It should be more focused on what the software does. What stakeholders does it serve? What functions does it perform? What is its utility? Not sure if 'broad perspective as an emerging and complex intersection of tools, disciplines, services, platforms, hardware, resources, and people"" does that.",Other,
C1,30,"I don't see how research software can be defined as hardware.
Likewise, I don't think that software can be defined as people.

Software is a tool that provides functions needed by the research group.",Other,
C1,31,Logiciel qui permet l'execution de travaux de recherche. ,Other,
C1,35,"The phrases ""data science"", ""machine learning', and 'artificial intelligence"" are not in your definition, but I write code in these areas every day and they are fundamental to  my research. So really, your definition is weak.",Other,
C1,40,"Software is not disciplines, hardware, or people.",Other,
C1,45,This definition is so broad i wonder how useful it is. Is there anything that doesn't meet this definition of research software?,Other,
C1,46,"This seems too broad to me.  I would take research software as ""software developed during the course of research and/or used in research activities"".  While services, people, etc ARE critical for the creation, use, maintenance of research software, I would consider them to be part of the broader ""research software ecosystem"".  I would distinguish the difference.",Other,
C1,49,"Too many words yet not specific enough.

""Research software directly serves science for the public good.""",Other,
C1,52,"The definition seems too broad to me, especially the inclusion of people.",Other,
C1,58,Kind of skips over the fact that software is fundamentally code.  A bit odd that you fold in 'hardware'.  Not sure what you mean by 'tools' in this context -- software can be a tool of sorts.  What do you mean here?,Other,
C1,59,"wow that's general and vague. No relationship to either software or research? it's basically saying that research software is anything that involves the intersection of any two or more of tools, disciplines, services, platforms, hardware, resources and people? I can think of a lot of things that meet that definition that are related to neither research nor software.

I'd define it as something more like digital tools used to conduct, enable, or facilitate some aspect of research, plus (maybe) the supports and services required to enable them to be used. 

I understand that you didn't want to exclude anything, but a definition that includes more things that don't belong to the specified domain than ones that do is not at all useful. 

Definitions need to exclude as well as include.  Or maybe you do mean to say that a hammer being used by a person as part of a home-repair service is research software?
",Other,
C1,72,"I don't agree with the term emerging, as some software e.g. BLAS and LAPACK is decades old and would still qualify as research software.

On the other hand rsync for example started out as research software but would not be qualified as tooling, in that case &quot;emerging&quot; is more applicable.",Other,
C1,95,La phrase est inutilement alambiquee. On doit la lire 3 fois pour comprendre qu'elle ne veut rien dire.,Other,
C1,99,"I agree with almost all the wording but do suggest removing the word ""hardware"" from the above definition, since this is about ""Research SOFTWARE"".",Other,
C1,110,"add at the end: ""... for academic research purpose.""",Other,
C1,112,Il me semble qu'un logiciel c'est un assemblage de libraries et de code afin de resaliser une ou plusieurs taches. La definition presentee me semble plus proche de ressource informationnelle ou outils de recherche.,Other,
C1,126,"My comprehension of ""research software"": research (adjective) software (noun), therefore its definition should include the things that lives digitally and must exclude the aforementioned hardware, and people.

My comprehension of ""software research"": software (adjective) research (noun), in this case, it is the research itself and it should include the people, the activities, etc.

It makes sense to me to show a file, a process, or even a concept and tell that this is a research software, or this is part of a research software.
But it does not make sense to point at a disk, a cable or a person and tell that this is part of a research software. Software and hardware are concepts that were defined in opposition and to include one into the other would only cause confusion to an external observer.",Other,
C1,127,Might be worth including to the definition that the aim of this complex intersection is to support research.,Other,
C1,136,Les mots calculs et ordinateurs sont absents. Ils ont au coeur du logiciel.,Other,
C1,139,"En toute franchise cette definition est epouvantable. Je suis developpeur logiciel et j'ai de la difficulte a comprendre votre definition.

Suggestion: Logiciels specialises utilises dans le cadre de recherche scientifique. ",Other,
C1,143,Je definirais logiciel de recherche plus simplement. Le logiciel (outil ou plateforme) de recherche permet a son utilisateur.trice de traiter des donnees de recherches.,Other,
C1,145,"That's not a definition!  It's not ""from a broad perspective"".  Research software is software generated during research, or used during research.",Other,
C1,148,My understanding of research software is software or tools used by researchers for conducting their academic research.,Other,
C1,149,"This definition is so broad it doesn't convey any meaning. For fun, I removed the word ""research software"" and asked ChatGPT 10 possible words or expressions to fill the gap, its answer were:

Technology
Innovation
Digital ecosystem
Information technology landscape
Tech industry
Cyberworld
Emerging technologies
Digital infrastructure
Tech landscape
Technological frontier
",Other,
C1,179,I had to change the answer to the previous question. It never occurred to me that software would include hardware and people.,Other,
C1,189,"Research software is actual software -- computer code and executable programs necessary to complete research.   It doesn't not include people even though people may be needed to create, use and maintain it.",Other,
C1,196,definition above would also apply to digital research infrastructure in general,Other,
C1,201,"This definition is impossible to understand.

Research software is software used by people to perform research.",Other,
C1,205,"I am happy to accept your definition but normally, I would consider the second half (the people) as distinct and separate category.",Other,
C1,207,"The purpose of this broad range of items is missing.
In other words, I would add something at the end of the sentence like at least: to support research. If not 'to support research capacities and projects'",Other,
C1,212,"This seems quite broad: what wouldn't count as research software under this definition? Is the Microsoft Office suite I use to draft my research paper ""research software""?",Other,
C1,223,I don't include people in my definition,Other,
C1,235,My interpretation of RS is software that is used to carry out research. ,Other,
C1,238,"Software is software. It is not hardware or people. 
A research software community would include people.
When software is deployed on a hardware system it may run as a platform or provide a service.
By your definition ""research software"" is practically everything so it means nothing.",Other,
C1,249,Not sure why research software would have to be 'emerging' and 'complex'.  It also doesn't include 'people'.,Other,
C1,253,"Research software is that which is needed for collecting, processing and manipulating research data across the research lifecycle.",Other,
C1,266,i don't consider people to be software. ,Other,
C1,267,Se sont des aides afin de parvenir  ,Other,
C1,272,"Research software is written to support and carry out research, for examples simulation codes, data analysis and machine learning applications and libraries, automation scripts, and web portals for collaborative research and data sharing.  Research software experts combine software expertise with research knowledge to create or maintain research software defined in this way.   The definition of research software should thus not include other digital research technologies that it interacts with, e.g. it should not include hardware nor non-research specific software such as contact  management systems, communications systems, or account management.",Other,
C1,274,"How can hardware be a subset of software? One can build software into hardware, but hardly the other way around. Software is a mathematical construct to process data and fit models, primarily, one would hope.",Other,
C1,288,"I would define research software as digital programs installed on your computer/licensed used to conduct research (e.g. NVivo). If I was pushed to extend it more broadly, I might include research tools/platforms (e.g. the DMP Assistant) which are browser-based. I'm not sure whether I would count platforms (or the content on platforms) that are being used as research materials (e.g. Twitter/tweets on twitter) as part of this definition.",Other,
C1,292,"There is no question that a variety of resources are needed to carry out computational research, but the term software becomes meaningless if it includes hardware, human resources, etc.",Other,
C1,300,"To me, software refers exclusively to code, not to hardware, and not to people developing or using the code (those are software developers or software users).",Other,
C1,323,"Pourrait être plus global, je n'associe pas logiciel et plateforme ou infrastructure de donnees de recherche avec logiciel",Other,
C1,324,"Data processing, simulation and analysis to generate patterns and scientific insights that otherwise would be hidden from us.",Other,
C1,326,I would not include the people as software,Other,
C1,338,Research software is any software that researchers develop to help further their research projects.,Other,
C1,349,"This definition is, extremely, far too vague.",Other,
C1,367,"I would rather not include directly hardware, knowing though that all softwares run on some sort of hardware.",Other,
C1,376,"I wouldn't have included people in the definition of software. They are within the ecosystem of the software, but not software itself.",Other,
C1,381,"- an &quot;emerging and complex intersection&quot; is vague
- disciplines and hardware are not &quot;software&quot;
- people are not &quot;software&quot;",Other,
C1,401,"Seems accurate. I would have expected mention of ""computers,"" ""computing,"" ""digital"" though.",Other,
C1,406,"I normally wouldn't have included hardware, but I suppose the hardware should be included to the extent that it is needed to run the software. I also typically do not include the people, but open to this definition...",Other,
C1,407,"This is too ambiguous, non-sense, full of big and trendy words, total non-sense",Other,
C1,417,Missing: algorithms,Other,
C1,418,I was pleased to see that you include users and software creators in your definition software itself.,Other,
C1,423,This is perhaps overly broad.,Other,
C1,425,"I would prefer a strict definition of ""software"" that confines it to program code to be executed on a computer system.",Other,
C1,433,"As far as I can tell, this definition is meaningless. I would define research software as `computer programs used for scientific research`. In particular, including `people` and `hardware` in the definition of `research software` is nonsensical.",Other,
C1,441,"Comment: that is the most vague description I have ever seen.

My definition: the programs/apps used by a computer to facilitate research",Other,
C1,442,"I find there is no clear definition of what research software is. Broadly speaking, it is a subset of software explicitly used to support research development and outreach. ",Other,
C1,445,You seem to confuse SOFTware with HARDware and the rest. Software is a very well defined word that does not need a re-definition. And I say this from the point of view of a computer scientist and software engineer. ,Other,
C1,452,"to me, research software is code that is run by a computer for research purposes",Other,
C1,458,"I think many people, and myself in years past, would have identified research software as only software  SPSS as an example, and would not have included platforms, tools, and people. ",Other,
C1,471,"I thought yes, but going further into the survey I'm now very confused.",Other,
C1,473,"I would define it as software supporting a research project to improve its quality, effectiveness, reliability, and/or costs. ",Other,
C1,476,"The definition is too broad and doesn't detail what research software actually is. It's a list,",Other,
C1,483,Too vague,Other,
C1,486,Terrible definition. What is NOT included here?  Stakeholders and hardware = RS?     Seems similar to the definition of DRI  - but at least that includes the word DIGITAL ,Other,
C1,489,"Definition peu comprehensible. ""intersection emergente et complexes d'outils ... ???",Other,
C1,497,"If the term is ""research software"" then by definition that must exclude disciplines, hardware, and people. It might also exclude ""resources"" depending on how that word is used. If keeping the definition above is a goal, then you need to use a different phrase than ""research software"" Rather, one way that I might define research software would be: ""The digital tools, applications, services, or platforms designed to enable specialized research objectives.""",Other,
C1,503,"I would not include hardware in the definition of a term including the word software - to me they are not the same. I consider research software to be the actual software programs used to conduct research or data analysis such as SPSS, NVivo, Excel, etc. I think the term defined breading is referring to Research Assets or Research Ecosystems inclusive of software, hardware, tools, and people.",Other,
C1,507,I don't think in terms of research software. I think in terms of libraries for R and Python.,Other,
C1,512,"I would not include the word emerging. Yes there is new research software being developed, however there is a wealth of existing software that is not contemplated if ""emerging"" is added. Or, could state ""existing and emerging""",Other,
C1,514,"I don't think this is a definition.  Remove the fluff and you're saying it's ""an intersection of tools"".  ""An emerging and complex intersection of tools, disciplines, services, platforms, hardware, and resources developed and used by people in various roles and disciplines to conduct or enable research.""",Other,
C1,523,"Cette definition represente le contexte dutilisation et de creation des logiciels de recherche mais ne definit ni le terme logiciel, ni le terme recherche.",Other,
C1,524,Les logiciels de recherche devraient contenir egalement les outils techniques developpes par les chercheurs comme acteurs et non pas juste comme consommateur,Other,
C1,526,Research Software is Software developed specifically for the purposes of supporting research applications. ,Other,
C1,539,"In the end, this definition seems off. Software is software. If it doesn't have code, it isn't software. There are a lot of peripheral things, but research software is about code that does research, and/or is used by researchers to do (possibly in a guidance or interpretative way) research.",Other,
C1,542,"To me, Research Software refers more to custom-developed code to serve a particular requirement.  It does not really include commercial software, or open source software commonly available. ",Other,
C2,21,"As a research software developer and one that believes this should be delivered as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) service to all researchers, I'm answering yes.",Other,
C2,30,My research depends almost entirely on software use and development.,Other,
C2,35,"Yes, but ""research software"" based on my extended definition above.",Other,
C2,40,Genomics analysis is all software.,Other,
C2,46,We develop software on an ongoing basis; use existing research software.,Other,
C2,52,"Yes, but I wish we had more dedicated research software, not making do with MS Windows applications.",Other,
C2,59,"Given that definition it's hard to say, but I need to use survey software, analysis software, several programming tools and environments, and so on.

Do I develop research software? I have written code that is used by others, But who knows.",Other,
C2,72,"it's critical to the research of the people I support, not my own.",Other,
C2,105,ABSOLUETLY. IT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART CURRENTLY,Other,
C2,112,"En etant que je suis informaticien au support a la recherche pour toute l'universite. La reponse serait : pour la majorite de la communaute de recherche oui, les logiciels de recherche sont essentiels mais pas pour tous.",Other,

C2,127,"My role do not include research, research Software is however critical to my work.",Other,
C2,137,not applicable,Other,
C2,181,"My research is entirely computational/ theoretical, and hence based on research software that either exists (usually) or is developed by us (sometimes)",Other,
C2,189,"By either definitions -- software (code) and all the necessary supports for that code (hardware, people, etc....) are critical to my research",Other,
C2,196,depends on what is meant with research software,Other,
C2,201,Absolutely. Custom written software is integral to all parts of our research projects.,Other,
C2,205,Research software as defined above is foundational to my work without which I would not be able to do what I do.,Other,
C2,207,research software as defined upper is crucial for real large collaboration between researchers; sharing information and discoveries; it's a leverage,Other,

C2,376,My job is to develop research software.,Other,
C2,406,"I am not doing research, but rather facilitating research. But it is essential to do that. ",Other,
C2,423,"Everything is digital, therefore everything requires software. Bu the above definition, it is almost impossible to conceive of a scenario where I would answer No.",Other,
C2,433,"Examples of software critical to my research are perfsonar, openstack, and xrootd.",Other,
C2,458,"With the more comprehensive definition, research software is fundamentally important to my research. ",Other,
C2,469,Essential,Other,
C2,473,"My team generally doesn't have access to them. Thus, we don't know how different it would be to have one available. I am sure it would help, though. ",Other,
C2,486,Well - when your definition is that broad - anybody who actually does research  will have to say YES.  Writing a paper with a word processor and emailing it to the journal apparently qualifies as using RS,Other,
C2,489,pas uniquement logiciel mais egalement le developpement du code en tant que tel. Le logiciel etant l'ensemble de l'uvre.,Other,
